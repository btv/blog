Surprise blog posting... YEAH!!!

While just checking out my stats for webpage views. I noticed a very
interesting thing. My post about converting [Gentoo to
Funtoo]({filename}/gentoo-to-funtoo-migration.md) has been
viewed 204 times. While that is very cool (at least to me), oddly enough
the vast majority of those numbers are from day, 192 visits in one day
to be precise, and my referral stats haven't changed a bit.

IMAGE LOST

So this leads me to draw two conclusions: 1) Google got attached by evil
code gremlins, who wanted to play with my head and make me think I have
more readers than I really do. OR 2) Someone really liked my article,
and posted it somewhere in such a way that a referral was not able to
get marked. But this would mean that 192 people really did visit my site
in day.

Regardless, I prefer to go with the second case. And would like to thank
all the people who made this odd accomplishment possible(that means
YOU!). I give you my gratitude. Thank you.

And of course, if anybody reading this has ideas on how this happened,
I'm all eyes.
