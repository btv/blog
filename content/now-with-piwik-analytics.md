About two and a half weeks ago I disabled Google Analytics for my site.
Today I have installed and configured [Piwik](http://piwik.org/). Since
there is very little traffic to the site in general these days and this
is my fault for not posting anything, I'm hoping this little post might
spark a visitor or two so that I can get a better idea of piwik
interface.

I'm hoping to have a more indepth review posting about piwik in the
future. But until then people are just going to continue to have to be
patient while I continue doing wedding "stuff".
