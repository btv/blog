Sorry, today's post will not contain anything technical. The past two
weeks I've been busy studying for my last finals, of which I passed. :)
As well as packing and moving from Portland to San Francisco. Because of
all the craziness that life has bestowed upon me recently I won't be
able to post anything geeky this week. But there is a silver lining to
this, I'll post something worth while next week.

</p>

Also, I've decided to change my format slightly, I will be posting twice
a month, instead of weekly, from now on. I'm doing this in the hopes in
reducing the timeline of posting, that I can produce technical posts of
higher quality, which I'm sure everyone would appreciate.

</p>

See you all next week.
