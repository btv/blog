So since the last update of [Pidgin](http://www.pidgin.im/") for
[Ubuntu](http://www.ubuntu.com/) broke yahoo compatibility. There are
currently two fixes for the problem:

- 1) Go through the process of configuring your sources.apt file, and
downloading the latest Pidgin client.

- 2) Make a small change in the current client's Yahoo account settings.

Just for simplicity's sake, I choose (and am going to explain how to do)
the second.

SO start with opening up the account manager like so:  

IMAGE LOST!

Then highlight the Yahoo account and click on the "Modify" button, like
so:

IMAGE LOST

A new window will pop up, click on the "Advance" tab on the top left.
And then add "cn." to the text area for "Pager Server" like it shows
below:

IMAGE LOST

And that is all you have to do, and you'll be chatting with your Yahoo
friends again in no time.
