In a conversation with a good friend of mine regarding his flash site,
he said that he would like to see tutorials created to help someone get
started in Flash. And seeing as how I'm a novice writer, as well as
novice Flash programmer, I thought that I would take this time to come
up with a few simple and easy to follow Flash tutorials to help someone
get a little exposure to doing some simple Flash stuff.

Since this tutorial is for the absolute beginner, I will start in the
usual fashion with the ever popular “Hello World” program. However, I'm
going to deviate from the norm at this point. If you search on the
interwebs for “Flash Hello World” you can already find some basic
write-ups on how to get a Flash program to regurgitate “Hello World”.
However, those write-ups show you how to do this in text. And this is
where I see a chance to do something a little different. I'm going to
show you how to do a “Hello World” but with a graphic instead. Is this
more productive? I have no idea... but feel free to tell me if you think
it is or isn't.

Ok, first think you need to do is either download this image
file - IMAGE LOST or
create your own image file. Now don't forget where you put it, we're
going to need it soon.

So let's start up by getting your Adobe Flash going. And of course once
its up click on File-\> New. At this point a new window should pop up.
Go ahead and make sure that “Flash File (Actionscript 3.0)” is
highlighted, if not then highlight it, and click “Ok”.

At this point you should be looking at a fresh new Flash file. AAAHHH
just get a wiff of that new file smell. So now lets go and bring up the
Library (for CS4 you can just hit CTL+L, don't ask me how to do that in
CS3, but if I did have to guess I'd try Window-\>Library). And let's go
and add a new symbol. Right click in that empty space, and choose “New
Symbol” in the menu.

IMAGE LOST

After selecting “New Symbol” a new window should pop up resembling this
one:

IMAGE LOST

so let's give this new symbol a name. How about “hello\_btn”? And also
make sure to choose “Button” in the type section. And click “Ok”. And
now you should see your new symbol in the Library. Now, while your able
to edit this button. Go open up that image file we talked about earlier.
And just copy and paste it into that button. Alright, click on the icon
called “Scene 1”. And all you have to do at this point is take your
mouse, click, and drag the “hello\_btn” over to the display area. And
just put that right in the center like so (yes, I recognize that the
photo isn't the best if the mouse was included it would probably look
better and make more sense. But that is what you'll be looking at when
you move the icon from the library to the main page):

IMAGE LOST

when you release the mouse, you'll notice that your text is right where
you left it. At this point we're done with the labor. Save your file,
and hit either Shift+F12 or go File-\>Publish. And after a little bit of
compiling (Chug, Chug, Chug) you'll have you first Flash Hello World
program. And you should feel proud of your new accomplishment.

I think the next flash tutorial will be about adding mouse interactions
to our button, but I'm not sure yet. We'll just have to see what
happens.
