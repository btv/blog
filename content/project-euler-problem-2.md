I've got problem #2 in the bag.

Problem #2 goes like this:

```
Each new term in the Fibonacci sequence is generated by adding the previous
two terms. By starting with 1 and 2, the first 10 terms will be:

1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, ...

Find the sum of all the even-valued terms in the sequence which do not
exceed four million.
```

And my code goes as follows:

Haskell:

```haskell
--fibinaci :: (Num a) => a -> a -> [a]
fibinaci a b
  | sum' > 4000000 = []
  | otherwise = sum' : fibinaci b sum'
  where sum' = a + b
 
problem2 = sum $ filter (even) (fibinaci 0 1)
```

Python:

```python
#!/usr/bin/python
 
def fibinaci_list( in_list, input1, input2):
  flip = True
  while ( input1 + input2 < 4000000):
    if( flip == True):
      input1 = input1 + input2
      in_list.append(input1)
      flip = False
    else:
      input2 = input1 + input2
      in_list.append(input2)
      flip = True 
 
def even(n):
  if n % 2 == 0:
    return True
  else:
    return False
 
 
def main():
  first_list = []
  fibinaci_list(first_list, 0, 1)
  second_list = filter(even, first_list)
  print "%s" % (sum(second_list))
 
if __name__ == "__main__":
  main()
```

And finally, Perl:

```perl
#!/usr/bin/perl
 
my $total = 0;
my $count1 = 0;
my $count2 = 1;
my $flip = 1;
 
while( $count2 + $count1 < 4000000)
{
  if ( $flip == 1)
  {
    $count1 += $count2;
    if ( $count1 % 2 == 0)
    {
      $total += $count1;
    }
    $flip = 0;
  }
  else
  {
    $count2 += $count1;
    if ( $count2 % 2 == 0)
    {
      $total += $count2;
    }
    $flip = 1;
  }
}
 
print $total;
```

Originally, I tried to copy the Python algorithm to Perl, using an array
instead of a list. That didn't work. The program would always fail due
to out of memory errors. To solve this problem I changed the program to
work without using arrays and just took the whole fibinaci function out
and put it into main.

As always, constructive comments for the code are welcomed.
