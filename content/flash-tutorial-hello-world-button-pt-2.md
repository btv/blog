Welcome to another installment of this Flash “Hello World” tutorial. In
this tutorial I'm going to show you how to change the color of the
button when you click on the button. Its really quite easy, and should
only take us a minute to do. Let's get right to it.

I'm going to assume that you've kept your fla file from the previous
tutorial. If not here is a copy of
"mine" (IMAGE LOST)
feel free to start with that. (Or if your just joining us and have no
real starting place.)

So with your “Hello World” button in front of you, its time to make it
perform an action. Let's right-click on the text and choose “Edit”. At
this point you'll notice that the timeline has changed.

IMAGE LOST

In short, you can modify these to make the button look differently
depending on the action involved. So, within this new timeline,
right-click on the square under “Down”. (And within the menu click
“Insert Blank keyframe”. You should be aware of two things: 1) your
black “Hello World” is gone. 2) The layout of the timeline has changed.
Well, the answer to one is, you want it blank, that is how you get to
have multiple images in one button. And I'm not sure why the timeline
changed, but when I find out I'll let you all know.

So within the blank page, go and copy "this image" (IMAGE LOST)
just like you did in the previous write up. And now if you test with a
little Control + Enter (on windows) you'll see your new button in
action. See, I told you this was going to be easy.

If you decide to do the same thing with the “Over” section instead of
the “Down” used above, you'll get your button to change when your mouse
goes over the button, as opposed to clicking on it.

In the next tutorial, which I believe I will have next week, I'm going
to go over how to make the button to go to a website when you click on
it.
