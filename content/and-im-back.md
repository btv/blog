After about a month of fighting with ISP's and registrars the blog has
returned. I haven't stopped writing during this time and I plan on
posting a new post next week. Once all the DNS servers are done
propigating my server's IP around the interwebs of course.

I hope everyone has been well and I look forward to your comments as I
continue to expand the content of this blog.
