As I mentioned in my [last post]({filename}/long-absence-new-look.md), I'm still trying to find my information security blogging voice. I'm hoping one way to find it is by sharing what I'm learning about and why I think it's worthy enough to share.

At the end of December 2015, the Chaos Communication Congress finished up, and soon after most of the videos were posted online.  As soon as I heard about that I started going through the titles and watching what sounded interesting. Tor Onion Services instantly piqued my interest as I'm a fan of tor and run a relay.  Learning a little more about [tor onion services](https://www.torproject.org/docs/hidden-services.html.en) seemed like a good use of my time.

While the page I linked to above gives a basic overview of hidden services, I wanted a more in-depth look and the video did not disappoint. It's perfect for anyone who's ever been curious about Tor Onion Services, but were too afraid to ask. I've also been inspired to put my new knowledge into practice, and plan to spend some time learning how to host this site through an onion service.
