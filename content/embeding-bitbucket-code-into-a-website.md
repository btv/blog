So this post is to answer a question from my friend OJ about embedding
code from bitbucket into a website.

I'm going to be taking for granted that you already have a bitbucket
account, as well as content uploaded into it.

So let's start by looking at the screen shot below. Once your already
logged into bitbucket, and looking at the source tab.

```IMAGE LOST```

So travel down through the directories until you get to the file that
has the code you wanna post online. Click on the file you want uploaded
and within the file link you'll see this section:

```IMAGE LOST```

And click the "embed" button on the right hand side.

```IMAGE LOST```

In the place where the "embed" button was, will be the html code, just
click the "copy" button and that html code will be in your buffer. Paste
that code into your html code, and BAM you'll see the file of code all
nicely highlighted with number lines and able to be shared with
everyone.
